General
- Peform experiment
- Write report (theory and about programming)
- CertainOrderManager needs to log whenever a task finishes (this probably requires a writelock)
- Implement some kind of either synchronize or RW-lock in CertainOrderManager

Nice to have
- Currently negative quantities are allowed at both ends, this should probably be changed at tests should be added t ocheck the fail condition
- Clean up: Refactor and move things like filepaths to ONE place only
- Document code
